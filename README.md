# 3 Features of my Course Registration Assignment
## 1. useState and useEffect : 
     __useState__ is a React Hook used for managing state within functional components. It allows me to declare and manipulate
     state variables in my component without using class components. In the example, useState is used to create a count state 
     variable that keeps track of the counter value. The setCount function is used to update this state variable. 
     __useEffect__ is another React Hook used for handling side effects in functional components. It help me Data Fetching, 
     Conditional Rendering etc. i used many times these two hook in my projects.
## 2. Props: 
     "props" is a shorthand for "properties" and refers to data passed between components, allowing customization of their
     behavior or appearance. In my project i used several props(Cards, Card, Carts, SingleCart etc). I used props in my project 
     as variables and functions.
## 3. SweetAlert:

    SweetAlert is a JavaScript library (in this case ,  I used SweetAlert2) used for creating beautiful and customizable alert
    dialogs and pop-up messages in web applications.I didn't know about it. But I used in my project with the help of some youtube
    videos and this releted articles. This is very interesting concept and seems stunning in UI.In the example, SweetAlert is used
    to display a pop-up dialog with the title      and a  a icon . I used two SweetAlert in my project .These SweetAlert used based 
    on a condition.
