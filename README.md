# 1. 3 Features of my Course Registration Assignment

## a. SweetAlert:

    SweetAlert is a JavaScript library (in this case ,  I used SweetAlert2) used for creating beautiful and customizable alert
    dialogs and pop-up messages in web applications.I didn't know about it. But I used in my project with the help of some youtube
    videos and this releted articles. This is very interesting concept and seems stunning in UI.In the example, SweetAlert is used
    to display a pop-up dialog with the title      and a  a icon . I used two SweetAlert in my project .These SweetAlert used based 
    on a condition.
## b. UI/UX Considerations:
it may also exhibit good user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) practices, making it visually appealing and user-friendly.
My project allows users to interact with it by selecting cards and moving them to another section, creating an engaging and dynamic user experience.
It may also





## c. React Skills:
My  project utilizes React(a popular JavaScript library), jsx(dynamic HTML), CSS(for STYLE) and a readme file for building user interfaces, increasing my proficiency in React development. it demonstrates your ability to control and manage component behavior based on user actions.


# 2. useState and useEffect : 
     - useState__ is a React Hook used for managing state within functional components. It allows me to declare and manipulate
     state variables in my component without using class components. useState is used to create a count state 
     variable that keeps track of the counter value. The setCount function is used to update this state variable.
     In this example, I initializes the count state variable with an initial value of 0 or a empty array([]), and setCount is used to update its value when the "Increment" button is clicked.
     - useEffect__ is another React Hook used for handling side effects in functional components. It help me Data Fetching, 
     Conditional Rendering etc. I fetch data from API (course.json) and show the data using map method. In useState,  the first argument is a function that contains the code for the side effect 
     The second argument is an optional array called dependencies. It specifies when the effect should run. If it's an empty array ([]), the effect runs only once after the component mounts. If you provide 
     dependencies (e.g., [prop1, prop2] or [stateVariable]), the effect will run whenever any of those dependencies change. But I used just empty array because I need runs my data one time. i used many times 
     these two hook in my projects.
